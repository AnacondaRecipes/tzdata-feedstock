  # This package needs to be noarch because it uses POSIX system APIs.
  # The Windows build will be skipped when built to avoid Prefect failures.
  # There is no Windows port available and porting to Windows is not trivial.
  # However, the compiled package can be used on Windows.
  # Tzdata is utilizing system header files which is not compatible with macOS.
  # However We build on osx because sysroot_linux-<arch> depends on tzdata.
  # Since this package is data-only, we don't want any of the run-exports.

    and daylight-saving rules.
