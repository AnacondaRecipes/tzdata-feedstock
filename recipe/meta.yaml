  summary: The Time Zone Database (called tz, tzdb or zoneinfo)

  description: |
    The Time Zone Database (called tz, tzdb or zoneinfo) contains code and
    data that represent the history of local time for many representative
    locations around the globe.  It is updated periodically to reflect
    changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets,
    and daylight-saving rules.
